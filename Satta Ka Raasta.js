The bookshop is called Torinalli’s and offers popular fiction, the latest periodicals, and a few other books, but nothing particularly in depth.

The truth is, however, Parmi collects ideas. These are miscellaneous ideas that have been cast aside by their originator, but someone might find them of interest. She’ll admit that while none of them are extraordinary, you might find a new way to decorate your living room, a snippet of an unfinished song lyric, or just the right name for your baby. (You might also end up with an unworkable method for cleaning your fireplace, a ridiculous get-rich-quick scheme, or an unhealthy idea for dinner. Not all ideas are good.) Parmi makes no guarantees, but she charges only 5 crystal for each one. You don’t know what you’re going to get before you buy, and there are no returns. She will, however, buy your unwanted ideas for 1 crystal each, and she says they have to be substantive (although sampling her wares suggests otherwise sometimes). She rarely has enough containers available to buy more than six or seven ideas at a time. A sold idea is gone forever.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"Trypa":[{"#":"IMAGE: Trypa.jpg"},"^This huge structure is a large tenement building with thousands of hole-like windows in its almost organic-looking exterior walls. Those who live here, speaking with dark cynicism, call their homes pods or eggs and refer to themselves and the other residents as worms or insects. The Trypa serves as an excellent example of the outright evil that can be achieved thanks to the corruption of this district. The tenement is used by psychopaths from the Vespertine to slowly drain the life force of those who live inside. In a way, the building is a living thing, but it’s a parasite. The residents are depressive and sickly—but not so sickly as to cause panic or suspicion—and they die young. The Vespertine, who secretly own the Trypa, pay off the local gerent to look the other way when there are complaints. Meanwhile, the dark fanatics use the energy they steal to fuel their black-hearted schemes.","\n","end",{"#f":3}],"#f":3}],"listDefs":{}};
